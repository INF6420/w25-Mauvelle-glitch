            <h1 class="h1">Employment with Lapeer, 2019-2023</h1>
            <p>My time with Lapeer was what illuminated me to a career in the information field. Their approach to the community and institution management inspired me to further myself in the vocation. While every system is not perfect, and has their ups and downs with time, the time I spent there will not be forgotten. There are many characteristics about the Lapeer library that I praise during my time there, many aspects that helped shape who I desire to be as a librarian in my coming years as I branched off from them to further my own experiences.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Mentorship and Connection</h2>
               <p>As a smaller library system, more mentoring was available for those that desired it, as well as opportunities to try new projects and grow. This was an aspect I took a hold of until it landed me positions for events, which I found I fell in love with. No matter what project that was being brought up, there was always someone with knowledge ready to lend a guiding or physical hand to help you out on your way. Pages, Librarian Assistants, and Librarians themselves all pitched in to assist to create the best experiences for patrons as possible. </p>
                
                <p>Much of this mentorship was possible due to the smaller size of the library and staff, and the dedication of the director to keep in touch. Branch Managers were isolated in their home branches for the most part, only interacting with the pages, scheduled staff, and patrons there, but by design of the schedule the director created, had to work at least one shift at the main branch, even the director was held to that and took an evening to work at a desk to interact with patrons. This ensured that those in isolated areas such as the Branch Managers or admin offices would have an opportunity to touch base with heads of departments, be involved in the central community of staff and patrons, and gain understanding and relationships with people outside of their branch. This helped facilitate a network that enveloped all of the employees together for resources, encouragement, and growth of coworker relationships. A feature of ‘Friday Share,’ where coworkers are encouraged to share fun, inspirational, or happy events that they noticed or happened in their lives. The birth of a new child, the first flower of spring, nothing was too small to share along the group email for Fridays. This contact allowed distant coworkers to remain in touch and part of each other’s area of influence at work.</p>
                
<h2 class="h2">Programs and Experiences</h2>
                <p>As stated before, taking on new projects or jumping in to help someone else was highly encouraged. There may have been some hurdles such as sensitive training or children protocols to learn before you’re able to run a program but the training was easily set up and eagerly taught. </p>
                
                <p>To start with, a program would need to be first introduced to the Head of the related department, sectioned into Adult, Teen, and Children programs. From there, constructive criticism was given alongside support as the employee and department came together to work through hurdles and set realistic goals and outcomes for budget and possibility. Once every aspect was looked at, dates would be set, schedules would be changed, materials requested, and flyers and ads set out to possible program attendees. From there, all support to make the program successful, i.e. more people, finding the best materials for it, and training if needed, are given. This is a great safety net for those trying to expand their abilities and skills.</p>

                <p>Another aspect of training the library heavily leaned into was webinars and conferences, willing to cover any costs to allow their employees training beyond their local abilities. Webinars were frequently sent out to staff via email with open invitations to sign up and attend. Promising new employees were selected for conferences to get them into the network and gain better understanding of the library system outside of their home one. Education for degrees, while not supported financially, was encouraged and assisted for finding funding if needed. The encouragement and experience I gained from here sent me off to further myself in the world of information science.</p>
                
 <h2 class="h2">Department Organization</h2>
                <p>Departments were organized as evenly as they could be, so as to not offset and overwork the small number of librarians that were on staff. The Librarians were given two major aspects of each department: programming oversight and collections development. As such, children’s programs and collections were grouped together the Children’s department, teen programming and any fiction not juvenile were grouped together under the Fiction Department, and lastly, adult programming and any nonfiction not juvenile were grouped together under the Nonfiction Department. This allowed all the aspects of the library and patron interaction to be divided evenly and their areas of influence clearly defined to not muddle between. If you had a juvenile item, it was dictated to the Children’s Head and no one else. Each department had its own budget and employees to assist under it, with flexibility to work with any other worker that had an idea and wished to present it. How it expands into other branches past the main branch, is that Branch Managers are able to recommend books to them for purchase at their libraries, which are reviewed and approved or rejected by the Heads.</p>
                
<h2 class="h2">Observation</h2>
                <p>While I enjoyed the freedom that I had to explore aspects of the library system that resonated with me, there were facets that tried to hide itself in the cracks of this set up. For one, it was hard to set boundaries once you started gaining experiences with different tasks, to remove yourself from an overload of tasks was looked down upon by the admin, and once you were in the thick of it, it was easy to burn yourself out that way. The open invitation to experiences could be a double edged sword if you were not careful, leading to quick burnout once you reached the output you wanted.</p>

                <p>Branch Managers were left to their own time, with only one day at the main branch required. While it is good to keep in touch, the isolation of the branch for the rest of the week can be stifling and discouraging. While guidance was a call away, sometimes it was hard to gain access to those resources between their busy schedule and being bounced around to someone who was available. While Branch Managers have a say at what items are brought into collection, where they are placed, and how they are organized, it is the Department Heads who have final say on what gets bought, what gets placed, and how it gets placed. There are two to three levels to get through to get things done and while it is rare for a no to be said, it can be time consuming and tedious. Which can often bar initiative for change in the first place.</p>
                
                <p>Disputes were left between coworkers, as with the system set up, only a few workers were directly under the Librarian Heads, all others were under the Assistant Director. This meant that discipline came directly through either the Director or Assistant Director with no HR to mediate. Many times this could lead to mismanagement of coworker’s situations and environments if not enough care was given. Heads were many times removed from disciplinary action despite having full knowledge of the situation and acting as supervisor for the majority of the time. The actual supervisors, the Director and Assistant Director were removed from the building and environment most of the time, as the Admin building was in a separate building not on the main library grounds. This left many conflicts unresolved and allowed employee resentment to grow if a situation was left mishandled.</p>
                
                <p>Funding for departments or employees given to Heads were based on the impact of programming the department had on the public. This skewed the manpower and budgets of each department unequally, with Children’s gaining an entire other full time person, plus a dedicated part time person, more funding, and more marketing backing. Nonfiction had three dedicated part time workers to assist in programming, while Fiction had only two non dedicated workers who had other tasks on top of their assistance to Fiction. This brought forth dissent between the heads as not everything was as equally split for managing tasks as first intended. While arguments could be made that notoriously, the ages of 13-18 are the hardest to reach due to their schooling and extracurricular activities, and ages of 12 and under are far more easier to reach due to their time available and productivity of their parents, the discrepancies between the departments were glaring.</p>
                
<h2 class="h2">Assessment</h2>
                <p>The varying aspects of the Lapeer Library system during my time there were overall a good experience, and allowed me to expand my network of people and skills past what other library systems would encourage. I have found lifelong there through patrons and coworkers alike and have a myriad of stories to tell and learn from as I went on from Lapeer to other systems that fit my life better at the time. The encouragement of the love of information science is what grounded my decision to continue in this field, and one I do not regret. The positive aspects that I had gained there and the experiences in the field are something that I carry with me as I traverse new libraries and expand my network of people and skills. Their hands-on approach to help mold new employees to be the best they can be is an approach I realize that I would not get in many different libraries, and I am ever more grateful for my start there upon that realization. The close knit bonds that the library sought to forge between its workers through open communication, positive themes, and after work activities to grow the library together created a safety net for any worker to find their feet and way of approaching patrons with their best abilities. Whether it was programming, database organizing, archiving, community relations or more, it was encouraged and guided to reach the best outcome of ideals. The ideology promoted here was one that facilitates learning and growth upon one’s own skills and specialities, over rigid formats of minimal expectations of what a library employee should be.</p>
