            <h1 class="h1">A Study in Librarianism</h1>
            <p><div class="featured-text-container"><p>My story in the field of librarianship is one that was not intended but one I realized that I fell into naturally. My background is in humanities, with a broad scope of philosophy, psychology, and sociology; which gives a dabble into a myriad of perspectives. I entered into this field on a need; it was an available job that was local and flexible as I worked towards stable footing financially. Yet that whim of acceptance for a part-time job as a sub for the library led to a stable part-time position, then a position involved in programming, to finally a stable full time position that I find puts me in a place where I am able to assist and touch the lives around me.</p></div>

                <div class="featured-text-container"><p> As I stated above, I started as a Librarian Assistant Substitute at the Lapeer District Library during the summer of 2019. After a crammed two weeks of training where I was given an introduction by learning the system, terminology, policies, layout, and nuances of the job I was sent out when needed. It was a vocation that I quickly realized combined many aspects of my prior background to this new field. It had aspects of nuances of psychology, sociology, and even a bit of philosophy through connecting with co-workers and patrons alike. Each person that walked in when I was working was a new type of interaction, a new request, a new perspective, and a new puzzle to help figure out with them. Everything here was stable, yet fluid. The policies allowed leniency that gave solutions numerous ways to reach it and thus allowed multiple plans to fall back on if the first did not turn out to be the most applicable. Discernment was a skill that was refined through these situations as one way that would be easy and natural for me, turned out to be difficult to walk through a patron with, or terminology that patrons use vs what they want was something to pick through and reveal. Social skill sets were put to the test as I waded through patron needs with appropriate levels of assistance. Then came the trying times for everyone of the Covid-19 epidemic.</p></div>
                
                <div class="featured-text-container"><p>During this time services were limited, hours were cut, and employees furloughed as libraries tried to adapt to the new times we found ourselves in. Given my younger age and flexibility in schedule, I offered to serve on the front lines during these times of scattered information. This enabled me to be at the forefront for promotions when spots were opened up through the retirement of some co-workers in this pandemic. I was promoted from Substitute to Branch Manager within a year of being a sub, something I recognize as lucky despite the grave situation. From there I worked alongside my co-worker to run the Hadley branch of the Lapeer District Library. Organically, we worked smoothly together as she watched after the checks and balances of the branch that allowed me to focus fully on programming. I spent three years there building up children’s and adult programs from a very small patron pool, eventually reaching interest from other county areas and library patrons to grow the number of attendees. I assisted with creating childrens’ programs where kids met and played with each other and caretakers were given rest and interaction with other adults as the children created decorated plates, finger puppets, slime, and a myriad of other products put forward by me. For adults I reached to connect history with local, and worked alongside the Hadley Historical Society for hosting presenters geared towards the interests of the community with input form both the society and patrons.</p></div>

                <div class="featured-text-container"><p>I divided the majority of my time there plus one day at the main branch and another at the administration branch, assisting with more cataloging duties and mangereal to assist my supervisors. This allowed me to expand my knowledge past simple references questions and work to develop patron’s needs from the perspective and insight they gave me. I created a system of cataloging graphic novels for ease of patron’s search, as popular graphic novels that fall under DC or Marvel are known to be under multiple authors. As the prior system was under the author’s last name, this scattered stories about the heroes throughout the self, making it an eye spy game for those browsing. With the supervision of the Head of Fiction, I worked to create one that gathers stories by character, granting an easier browsing experience for patrons. I enjoyed my time here for three years, building relations and community with my patrons I met.</p></div>
                
                <div class="featured-text-container"><p>When I had grown my skills I had moved onto more beneficial positions for me, leading me to the Genesee District Library from 2023 to present. My skills from Lapeer allowed me to swiftly take action here as a Librarian Assistant, falling into ease with my coworkers as we worked to assist patrons together. Tag teaming situations were far more common in this district, and I learnt much from my coworkers quickly in the first few weeks of my employment. Even now that I have gained capabilities to swiftly serve patrons, I know that my coworkers are within reach or a phone call away to assist, something that was a bit more difficult to gain in Lapeer. As I continue to stay at Genesee, there are many aspects between the systems, management, and work environment that I find interesting when compared. This website has been created to chronicle those comparisons and act as a report of sorts to what I have gained and learnt through each of these systems.</p></div>
