            <h1 class="h1">Employment with Genesee, 2023-Present</h1>
            <p>My time with Genesee has been informative of regulations and expectations by other library systems. As one of the largest library systems, class 6, in the state of Michigan, with a long history before the union of the district, the libraries under the Genesee District Library are mostly independent. With the majority of the libraries having existed before the major merge in the late 20th century, many of them continued to have their own paths and connections with their community, the only thing changing is the authority over them. Due to this, each library is unique in its approach to the public and collections for the community. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Mentorship and Connection</h2>
            <p>Genesee District Library is wide and vast, with numerous employees at various locations and levels. While not mentorship exactly, there is a wide array of workers that you can turn to for assistance. The way that the system is set up between libraries and administration gives regulated people to reach out to for specific problems, leading to less run around time as you work to solve patron’s requests. How the system is set up, allows for a Librarian and the pages to be stationed at each library, who is known as the Branch Librarian, the Administration to focus on their work in a separate section along with the Technical Services, and  Librarian Assistants rove through the branches, switching through daily to allow for the flux of call-ins, time off, or more hands for programming if needed. While hectic, this system does allow for LA’s (Librarian Assistants) to gain experience in different environments and with different people, creating a rounded experience. This exchange of LA’s is also a form of connection, allowing workers to create, facilitate, and share ongoings with each other as they move. While it is a connection, it is sporadic, as it may be weeks or even months before you see a certain coworker again; especially with smaller branches where a different LA may be placed there once a week. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Programs and Experiences</h2>

            <p>The Community Relations Department (CR) handles any and all forms of programming, any program idea or community inquiry goes through them to develop. Unfortunately, while the library does encourage employees not of the CR to participate in programs, there are a myriad of hurdles that do not make it easy. First and foremost, anyone outside of the Administration and Manager positions are a part of the Union at Genesee District Library. In terms of participating in programming, the Union hinders this and is the major hurdle to cross upon leading a program while you are not in the CR department. The Union is there to make sure that no worker is abused, which fundamentally, is to protect the worker. This also makes sure that anyone outside of the CR department does not infringe on CR duties, whether they are willing or not. CR cannot request any action from workers outside their department, and any worker that does go through all the hoops to lead a program, may be moved the day of if they are an LA, causing someone from the CR department to take over anyways. Many of this negates even reaching out past the CR department for programs and most times unless it is a Librarian who won’t be moved, they do not assist. All of this definition of duties of CR does allow for a cohesive department focused only on programs and building and facilitating community relations for the best possibilities of the community.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Department Organization</h2>

            <p>As I touched briefly on above, the main departments are the Administration, Tech Services, CR department, and IT department. The Librarians and LAs are more sorted into layers than departments, with divisions between the two positions and the branches affiliated, i.e. all LAs are below Librarians and sorted by seniority by the Union, and Librarians are sorted by which branch they are the librarian of and seniority, with a higher level of Senior Librarian attached to specific locations such as our busiest or largest branches. This can be confusing at first, with intricate levels and seniority given to those that earned it through time but once understood, gives a great list of numbered resources based on how much seniority. You know that a senior librarian would be a catchall for any strange situation or hiccup on a policy, you know a higher seniority LA would know more about a specific branch as you are navigating your way. The seniority list is a great resource to pull from their experiences to help assist the public or your fellow coworker better. While the Union works to keep every worker protected against overworking, it also helps show guidelines of what is your responsibility or someone else’s. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Observation</h2>
            <p>The Genesee Library is more concerned with places filled and patron’s needs met. This prerogative is a great motivation to put forward as it removes all other distractions from the front desk, an LA is there to assist the patrons and Librarian first and foremost, there are no other duties besides that. That allows for full depth interactions between library staff and patrons to occur, creating opportunities for the most positive outcome. </p>

            <p>Besides Collection Development, Branch Librarians are the same prerogative as LAs, working to create a welcoming environment for their patrons. As the permanent face of that local library, they are the worker that the patrons will become most familiar with and need to keep that in mind with patron interactions. LAs quickly pop in and out, alleviating tension with the patrons if an interaction goes awry. In terms of Collection Development, the only restriction the Librarians have is to notify the Tech Services department if they decide on purchasing something outside of their main providers such as Ingram or Midwestern Tapes. Everything else is theirs to make their own, what items to get, where to put them, even down to the furniture placed there, everything is up to their discretion of choice. The interactions that happen in their branches are also more regulated to their intentions, with their discretion of how heavily to enforce policies to create a library that is tuned to their patrons.</p>

            <p>For Librarians wanting to be more involved in their local community, everything must go through CR, which, while making sure that everything is organized, can be tedious and stifling. I have heard much discontent of the CR department’s hand involved as it slows down processes and complicates them further, sometimes outright halting them. While the CR department is great for keeping the Librarian's worry free at the desk for the world outside of their library, it can hinder their own relations past that door.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Assessment</h2>
            <p>Genesee District Library prides themselves on individualism and preservation of communities. There are a myriad of levels of people to go to depending on where one is stationed and a lot of nuances to navigate. It is easy to get confused, turned around, or lost completely as an LA due to jumping from one independent and individualized library to the next. Everything is different, from the setup of the library collections, to the organization of the desk and library supplies and priority of duties. Some librarians have everything cataloged for their absence in easy format for learning LAs while others do not. The enforcement of policies and expectation of patrons change quickly, with many expecting the same amount of leeway the normal workers give, sometimes truly testing the grey area of neutrality we allow ourselves as library workers. Notes, organization, and lost belongings are placed in different areas with varying degrees of information to guide one through discovering their locations. Overall, it is not an ideal work system for LAs and puts much stress upon them as they bounce between areas; it can be stressful, disorienting, and burdensome to the traveler. It is, however, a great system that eliminates the need of substitute workers, allowing a large pool that can be allocated by need to keep all branches running if enough workers are on that day. Rarely is there a branch closed down due to worker shortage for lack of an available sub, another LA merely gets relocated mid shift to cover another’s absence.</p>

            <p>The system used and the lack of updates to the collections overall from the libraries creates a frustrating library catalog system, both for workers and patrons. With the enormous number of items, independent libraries, and lack of workers in the Tech Services department, the catalog system is deprived of the attention it needs to keep up with the changing world. Any children’s book that is under a traditional chapter book is simply labeled easy in the system, despite being separated into board books, picture books, level readers, and early chapter books, sometimes broken down further. This quickly leads to frustration and dependance on the desk worker by patrons to simply find a book that they desire. Most of the time, traveling LAs need to depend on library pages to hunt down items that they themselves cannot easily find. It creates a jarring picture for patrons, who believe their library workers to be efficient only to have that image peeled away by asking for the location of a mere item. Dead records for various branches also hinder searches for patrons and workers, A worker is quick to learn that a simple question of if an item is on the shelf takes five to ten minutes to properly investigate as other workers do not also assist in upkeep of the system, and many dead records or missing books are not properly reported, leading to frustrating accounts on worker and patron ends. Notes of the actual items can be scattered as well, as some prefer using the catalog system to document incidents, and others prefer to write in the physical item for upkeep, leading to hunts of staggering times to figure out situations and resolve them. This is also reflected in patron accounts as well when an item is charged yet you cannot tell an irate patron what went wrong as their account says nothing other than the charge.</p>

            <p>The Union is a double edged sword that while protecting workers from any potential firing situations and over working, also allows workers to grow complacent in their achievements as an individual worker. When the only task is to assist patrons, the ideal is that one would have plenty of time available to do so yet I have observed that is not always the case. With no drive to push oneself forward, a lackadaisical pace has been set for some workers, as the Union bars jobs that they can assist with and also covers the worker doing minimum for the library. The drive is based on the individual, which can be quickly snuffed out as they reach impasse after impasse with attempting to assist with anything other than seat warming at the desk. </p>

            <p>Overall, this system is great for allowing more one-on-one time with patrons, but the constant shifting and changes from library to library make it difficult to survive as anything other than a stationary worker. This system has a good center of ideals of patrons first, but unfortunately, with the myriad of hurdles boxing workers in, stifles more than assists in any personal worker development and steers them towards only one singular goal: to be present. If more communication and precedents were set between librarians as standards, I believe this system would be more effective for both the workers and patrons.</p>
